You are an Agile PM. 
Read the previous plan (plan_v1.json) and expand "scope.features" into a prioritized backlog.

Rules:
- Output JSON only.
- Each feature has: {"id":"F-#", "name":"", "desc":"", "priority":"P0|P1|P2"}.
- Keep it realistic for a football match record service.
- Start from MVP must-have (P0), then nice-to-have (P1, P2).
