# 📚 Documentation Management Guide

**Comprehensive guide for maintaining, updating, and organizing ScoreBoard project documentation**

**Version**: 2.0 | **Last Updated**: 2025-09-24 | **Next Review**: 2025-10-24

## 🎯 Documentation Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Single Source of Truth**: Each piece of information exists in exactly one authoritative location
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information organized from general to specific, overview to implementation details
- **Living Documentation**: Documents evolve with the codebase and remain accurate through active maintenance
- **Developer Experience First**: Documentation optimized for practical use by development teams

### Target Audiences
1. **New Developers**: Quick orientation and setup guidance
2. **Active Contributors**: Implementation guides and technical references
3. **Project Managers**: Status tracking and roadmap information
4. **Future Maintainers**: Architecture decisions and historical context

## 🏗️ Documentation Structure

### Tier 1: Project Entry Points

## 📋 Documentation Standards

### Writing Style Guide

#### Technical Writing Standards
- **Clear and Concise**: One idea per sentence, avoid unnecessary complexity
- **Action-Oriented**: Use active voice, imperative mood for instructions
- **Consistent Terminology**: Maintain consistent naming throughout all documents
- **Code Examples**: Include practical, working examples for all technical concepts

#### Language and Tone
```yaml
Primary Language: English (technical documentation)
Korean Usage: User-facing feature names and UI elements
Tone: Professional, technical, actionable
Voice: Direct, helpful, confident
```

#### Formatting Standards
```markdown
# H1: Document titles only
## H2: Major sections
### H3: Subsections
#### H4: Implementation details

**Bold**: Emphasis and key terms
*Italic*: Variable names and concepts
`Code`: Inline code and filenames
```

### Content Organization Patterns

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Content Creation

#### Before Writing
1. **Identify Audience**: Who will use this information?
2. **Define Scope**: What specific problem does this solve?
3. **Check Existing**: What's already documented?
4. **Plan Structure**: How does this fit into overall documentation?

#### During Writing
1. **Start with Examples**: Show working code first, explain second
2. **Use Active Voice**: "Configure the database" not "The database should be configured"
3. **Include Context**: Why is this needed? What problems does it solve?
4. **Test Instructions**: Every step should be validated

#### After Writing
1. **Review for Clarity**: Can someone unfamiliar with the code follow this?
2. **Verify Links**: All references work and point to current content
3. **Check Examples**: All code examples run successfully
4. **Update Cross-References**: Link from and to related content

### Information Architecture

#### Hierarchical Organization
```
General → Specific
Overview → Implementation → Troubleshooting
Concepts → Procedures → Reference
```

#### Cross-Reference Strategy
```markdown
# Bidirectional Linking
- Parent documents link to child documents
- Child documents link back to parent context
- Related concepts link to each other
- Implementation guides link to reference material

# Link Text Clarity
- Use descriptive link text
- Indicate document type (guide, reference, example)
- Show relationship (see also, prerequisite, related)
```

#### Progressive Disclosure
```markdown
# Layered Information Depth
1. README.md: High-level overview for all stakeholders
2. ARCHITECTURE.md: Technical overview for developers
3. docs/*.md: Implementation details for specialists
4. Code comments: Line-by-line implementation notes
```

### Collaboration Workflows

#### Team Documentation
```yaml
Documentation PRs:
  - Use descriptive titles
  - Include "why" in PR description
  - Tag relevant team members
  - Link to related code changes

Review Process:
  - Technical accuracy review
  - Clarity and style review
  - Cross-reference verification
  - User experience validation

Conflict Resolution:
  - Documentation disputes go to senior developers
  - Style questions follow established guide
  - Content questions require subject matter expert
  - Major changes require team consensus
```
